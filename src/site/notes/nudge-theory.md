# Nudge Theory

Nudge theory :

- proposes [positive reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_reinforcement "Positive reinforcement") 
- indirect suggestions
as ways to influnce the behavior and decision-making.

>A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.
