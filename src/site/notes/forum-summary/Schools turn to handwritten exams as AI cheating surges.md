## Schools turn to handwritten exams as AI cheating surges  

Source: [reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1lsbhrm/schools_turn_to_handwritten_exams_as_ai_cheating/)

The thread discusses the growing trend of schools reverting to handwritten exams amid a surge in AI-assisted cheating. This shift is portrayed not as an innovation but a return to traditional methods driven by necessity, as technological tools once meant to enhance learning have instead complicated assessment integrity.

Several participants expressed surprise that schools ever moved away from paper-based testing. Many attribute the transition to online exams to the pandemic and the subsequent push by tech companies, notably Apple and Google, to implement one-to-one device programs. Some users recalled taking handwritten tests as recently as the mid-2010s, noting how rapidly digital testing replaced traditional methods.

Critics argue that abandoning paper exams introduced myriad issues, including reduced retention, increased distractions, and opportunities for cheating, especially with AI-powered browser extensions and note-sharing platforms. Teachers noted that digital platforms like Google Classroom are convenient for grading and analytics but make cheating trivial, with students able to exploit lockdown browsers or use phones undetected.

Supporters of tech integration counter that digital tools streamline administrative tasks and provide insights into student learning standards. They argue that banning online tools entirely would be regressive, and instead advocate for improved safeguards and more robust IT infrastructure. However, many acknowledge that schools often lack the funding and personnel to implement secure systems effectively.

A prominent concern raised by educators was the behavioral impact of technology on students. Accounts described middle schoolers addicted to iPads, exhibiting withdrawal-like aggression when devices were removed. This led some to call for banning one-to-one devices at early education levels, suggesting they hinder both academic performance and social development.

There was also discussion of the limitations of alternate solutions like Scantron systems. Teachers reported logistical burdens, costs, and outdated equipment that frequently broke down. Others suggested hybrid approaches, such as oral assessments or AI-resistant question formats, though none were seen as scalable in underfunded districts.

Notable references include a Forbes exposé on the College Board's financial incentives in digital testing, anecdotal reports of students subverting firewalls and parental controls, and personal reflections on how handwriting aids memory. Some even mentioned turning to e-ink devices like the Supernote or Remarkable to retrain their handwriting skills—though this sparked debate over potential hidden marketing in comments.

Overall, the thread highlights a complex tension between technological convenience and educational integrity, with participants broadly agreeing that handwritten exams, while imperfect, are currently the most reliable safeguard against AI-enabled dishonesty.
