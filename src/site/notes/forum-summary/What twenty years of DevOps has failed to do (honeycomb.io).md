## What twenty years of DevOps has failed to do

The thread revolves around the claim that DevOps, after two decades, has not delivered on its original promise of bridging development and operations effectively. Participants debate whether DevOps is a failed methodology, a misunderstood concept, or simply an evolving practice distorted by organizational and cultural realities.

A central argument is that development and operations are distinct skillsets, and expecting individuals to excel equally in both is unrealistic. Critics argue that the industry’s push for “DevOps engineers” has blurred the lines, often resulting in underqualified teams where developers lack operational expertise and operations staff lack coding skills. Supporters counter that the original intent of DevOps was collaboration, not role consolidation, and that the failure lies more in organizational culture and management than in the methodology itself.

Several contributors highlight how DevOps has been reduced to a buzzword or rebranded sysadmin role, with companies using it to justify cost-cutting or restructuring. This perspective sees DevOps as commoditizing engineering roles, creating “zombie” teams that exist without clear purpose. Others defend DevOps as a principle of automation and collaboration, pointing to practices like CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, and infrastructure-as-code as evidence of progress, even if imperfectly applied.

The debate also touches on practical challenges. Examples include developers misunderstanding resource requirements in Kubernetes deployments, leading to system instability, and operations teams being constrained by management from building reliable tools. Some argue that modern ops necessarily involves coding—through configuration languages, Dockerfiles, or Terraform—even if it differs from traditional software engineering. Opponents respond that scripting and configuration are not equivalent to full-fledged engineering, underscoring the specialization divide.

Another recurring theme is the role of management. Critics emphasize that DevOps often fails because organizations adopt it superficially, without restructuring incentives or fostering trust between teams. Supporters note that when operations specialists are embedded within development teams, collaboration improves, leading to better outcomes. The conversation also extends to tooling, with frustration over YAML and configuration formats seen as symptomatic of stagnation in innovation.

In essence, the thread reflects a tension between DevOps as an aspirational methodology of collaboration and automation, and DevOps as a corporate label that has drifted from its roots. While some see it as a failed movement, others argue it remains viable when applied with genuine cultural and organizational commitment.
