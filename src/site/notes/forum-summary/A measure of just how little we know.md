## What Is Entropy? A Measure of Just How Little We Know  

Source: [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42415386)

This Hacker News thread explores the philosophical and scientific foundations of entropy, catalyzed by a Quanta Magazine article that argues entropy is not merely a physical property but a reflection of an observer’s ignorance. The topic attracts rigorous debate from physicists, information theorists, and curious readers, probing the boundaries between measurable quantities and interpretive frameworks.

Supporters of the article’s thesis assert that entropy is fundamentally observer-dependent. They argue that the classification of microstates into macrostates is an anthropomorphic act, shaped by the observer’s modeling choices and measurement constraints. References to E.T. Jaynes' writings are frequently cited to bolster the view that entropy quantifies missing information and varies with our experimental setups. Examples like Maxwell’s Demon and encrypted data streams are used to illustrate how knowledge—or its absence—affects perceived entropy.

Critics counter that entropy in physics, especially thermodynamics, is an objective quantity tied to a system’s probability distribution and independent of observers. They emphasize that entropy can be measured empirically using thermodynamic properties like enthalpy and heat capacity. One user argues that the consistency of entropy across different experiments and observers supports its physical reality, not its epistemic relativity. Another points out that quantum systems, despite their probabilistic nature, evolve deterministically from initial conditions, suggesting that any uncertainty is epistemological, not ontological.

The debate intensifies around statistical mechanics, where contributors grapple with whether entropy derived from macrostates is truly intrinsic or a reflection of limited observational granularity. Several participants underscore the distinction between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, warning that conflating the two may lead to unphysical conclusions, even if useful abstractions emerge. Spin echo experiments and cosmological hypotheses are briefly invoked to demonstrate entropy’s role in time asymmetry and the universe’s initial conditions.

Notable references shared include talks by Sean Carroll, Leonard Susskind, and Stephen Wolfram, which delve into entropy’s philosophical implications and its role in black hole physics. A 1965 article by Jaynes titled “Gibbs vs. Boltzmann” is spotlighted to illustrate entropy’s anthropomorphic roots. A participant also links their thesis on quantum cavities as a concrete case study in reconciling lossy and lossless systems through entropy-driven modeling.
