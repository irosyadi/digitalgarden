## The number-one type of childhood adversity kids face is at home

A discussion unfolded around a study revealing that 61% of teens experience emotional abuse—specifically being insulted or put down—by a parent or adult at home. The thread explored both the roots and repercussions of such adversity, highlighting the intergenerational dynamics that perpetuate harmful behaviors and the complex interplay between trauma, emotional regulation, and parenting.

Several commenters emphasized the importance of self-regulation in parenting, arguing that emotional safety stems from learned skills such as attunement, tolerance, and respect. Critics of permissive attitudes toward emotional abuse stressed that while trauma may explain negative behavior, it doesn’t excuse it; adults must take responsibility for healing rather than perpetuating cycles of harm. Some participants shared personal examples of seeking therapy and breaking toxic familial patterns, contrasting their outcomes with relatives who refused help and remained in dysfunctional roles.

A recurring theme was the disparity between public personas and private abuse. Many recounted how seemingly generous, well-liked adults became verbally or emotionally abusive behind closed doors. This “street angel, house devil” dichotomy resonated widely, with reflections on narcissistic traits, power dynamics, and performative parenting—such as insincere gestures of affection that felt more like control than comfort. Examples ranged from parents using their children as emotional outlets, to cases of favoritism and gendered neglect, which often left daughters more vulnerable to psychological harm than sons.

Supporters of trauma-informed approaches to healing stressed that abusive patterns are often rooted in the unresolved pain of the parents themselves. However, they also noted that growing up under such conditions warps self-esteem and relational expectations, often leading children to replicate dysfunction or retreat from relationships altogether. References to CPTSD, masking in neurodivergent individuals, and cycles of generational narcissism illustrated the lasting impact of emotional adversity.

Some users highlighted cultural normalization of insult-based humor and harsh parenting, observing that what was once seen as discipline or banter now reads as cruelty. A few lamented how societal structures—economic stress, lack of mental health access, and insufficient education on emotional intelligence—exacerbate the issue. Nevertheless, hopeful voices pointed out that healing is possible through therapy, conscious parenting, and breaking cycles via reflection and empathy.
