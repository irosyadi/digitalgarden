## Americans no longer see four-year college degrees as worth the cost

The thread centers on whether traditional four-year college degrees remain a worthwhile investment in the United States, given rising costs, shifting labor demands, and broader societal changes. Participants debate the historical role of higher education, its economic value, and its cultural significance, often contrasting liberal arts ideals with vocational training needs.

Critics argue that college has become an overpriced credentialing system detached from actual job training. They highlight how degrees were historically shoehorned into liberal arts institutions, creating a mismatch between academic ideals and workforce preparation. Some point to grade inflation, credentialism, and elite overproduction as evidence that universities now serve more as gatekeepers than as centers of genuine learning. Others emphasize the financial burden of student loans, noting that tuition costs have skyrocketed while the return on investment has become uncertain, particularly for non-STEM fields. Comparisons are drawn to Europe and Asia, where vocational and academic tracks are more distinct, and where education is often subsidized but more selective.

Supporters counter that the blending of liberal arts and professional training has produced valuable outcomes, fostering intellectual curiosity, civic engagement, and cross-disciplinary innovation. They argue that exposure to diverse fields enriches students beyond narrow job preparation, strengthening democracy and social progress. Historical examples, such as Germany’s 19th-century universities and America’s postwar expansion, are cited as evidence of higher education’s role in driving technological and cultural advancement. Advocates also stress that solving inequality and political dysfunction requires a more educated populace, not less, and that universities remain engines of research and societal development.

Opposing perspectives emerge around economic productivity and national decline. Some claim that America’s global dominance in the mid-20th century occurred when few had degrees, suggesting mass college attendance correlates with stagnation rather than growth. Others dispute this, noting that technological progress and modern job requirements demand higher levels of education than in the past. The debate extends to immigration and labor markets, with some noting reliance on less-educated migrant workers, while others argue automation will soon reshape low-skilled employment entirely.

Notable evidence includes references to Supreme Court rulings that pushed employers toward degree requirements instead of aptitude tests, critiques of financialization inflating GDP metrics, and examples of co-op universities like Northeastern that blend academic study with paid work experience. Participants also discuss the role of foreign students in sustaining U.S. institutions, the impact of declining government subsidies, and the cultural tendency to treat college as a social rite of passage rather than purely educational.

Overall, the thread reflects a deep divide: one side sees higher education as bloated, inefficient, and increasingly irrelevant to real-world skills, while the other views it as a flawed but essential institution that enriches individuals and society beyond immediate economic returns.
