## Maybe You’re Not Actually Trying – Discussion Thread  
Source: [usefulfictions.substack.com](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying)

The thread revolves around the essay’s central claim that many people mistake the feeling of effort for genuine action, and explores whether self-deception about “trying” is a widespread human tendency or an avoidable trap. Participants debate the nature of effort, discipline, and honesty in personal growth, often reflecting on their own experiences of motivation and failure.

Supporters of the essay’s perspective argue that intention without execution is a common pitfall, noting how easy it is to rationalize inaction by telling oneself that “trying” is enough. They emphasize the importance of consistency, discipline, and confronting discomfort as the true markers of progress. Several commenters highlight parallels with fitness, learning, and creative work, where sustained practice rather than bursts of enthusiasm leads to results.

Critics counter that the essay risks oversimplifying human behavior, pointing out that effort exists on a spectrum and that partial attempts or small steps can still be meaningful. Some argue that dismissing these as “not really trying” overlooks the psychological and situational barriers people face, such as burnout, mental health, or external constraints. They suggest that framing effort too rigidly may discourage rather than inspire.

Others take a middle ground, acknowledging the essay’s challenge to self-deception while stressing the need for compassion in evaluating effort. They argue that recognizing incremental progress and building momentum can coexist with the call for greater honesty about one’s actions. A few participants reference behavioral psychology and habit formation research, noting that sustainable change often begins with small, imperfect steps rather than immediate full commitment.

Overall, the discussion highlights a tension between the essay’s uncompromising stance on effort and the community’s broader recognition of nuance in human motivation. The thread reflects both admiration for the essay’s clarity and caution against its potential harshness when applied to real-world struggles.
