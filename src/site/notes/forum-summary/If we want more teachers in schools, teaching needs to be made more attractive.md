## If we want more teachers in schools, teaching needs to be made more attractive

A Reddit discussion sparked by a cross-national study explored the barriers to recruiting and retaining teachers, especially in public education systems. The original post referenced research from 18 countries suggesting that improving teacher pay, elevating the profession’s prestige, and resourcing schools more adequately could help address widespread teacher shortages.

Many contributors argued that while pay is an important factor, it’s overshadowed by the deterioration in working conditions. Teachers recounted experiences of physical danger, verbal abuse, and lack of administrative support, especially when dealing with violent or disruptive students. A recurring theme was the frustration over mainstreaming students with severe behavioral issues into general education classrooms without sufficient support, leading to compromised learning environments. This policy, driven by “least restrictive environment” mandates and equity goals, was seen by several educators as inadvertently harming other students and overburdening teachers.

Critics of current school policies noted how administrative inaction and a lack of disciplinary recourse have left teachers to manage classroom crises alone. Some mentioned the “No Child Left Behind” legacy and funding models tied to enrollment as contributing factors to the pressure to retain students regardless of fit or readiness. Teachers expressed resentment over being held responsible for student failures while lacking resources, time, and even basic classroom supplies—which some reported paying for out of pocket. Others pointed out that newer educational models focused on engagement and higher-order thinking often neglect fundamental skills, placing further strain on teachers to fill learning gaps.

Supporters of inclusion-based education acknowledged its importance but emphasized the failure to provide adequate accommodations and staffing to make it workable. Some shared examples of districts with high pay, strong unions, and supportive administrations that experience fewer shortages and more teacher satisfaction, suggesting systemic differences in policy implementation and local governance.

A number of teachers and support staff described how the scope of their role has expanded beyond teaching to include surrogate parenting, therapy, and social work, often without training or compensation. This mission creep, exacerbated by broader social issues such as poverty, family instability, and reduced support staff, was cited as a major factor driving burnout and early career exits. One high school teacher noted how loyalty and expertise are rarely rewarded, with career advancement requiring a shift out of the classroom.

The discussion also touched on cultural perceptions of teaching, performative respect during the COVID-19 pandemic, and longstanding economic undervaluation of educators. While some optimistic voices claimed joy still exists in teaching, others viewed online educator forums like r/Teachers as reflections of a profession increasingly marked by exhaustion and disillusionment.
