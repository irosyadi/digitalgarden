## How elites could shape mass preferences as AI reduces persuasion costs

The discussion centers on whether artificial intelligence, by lowering the cost of persuasion, enables elites to more easily shape public opinion. Participants debated the implications of AI-driven messaging compared to traditional propaganda and advertising, with attention to trust, manipulation, and the democratization of influence.

Several commenters argued that the phenomenon is not unique to AI. They noted that persuasion has always been tied to cost, citing historical examples like the printing press, targeted ads, and troll armies. In this view, AI is simply another tool that reduces costs, rather than a fundamentally new dynamic. Critics emphasized that elites have long used media and technology to influence mass preferences, and AI merely accelerates existing trends.

Supporters countered that AI represents a qualitative shift. They stressed that large language models (LLMs) can generate personalized, authoritative-sounding content at scale, making propaganda more effective and harder to detect. Some highlighted evidence that people tend to trust AI outputs more than other media, partly because of their confident tone. This raises concerns that wealthy individuals or corporations could exploit AI to control narratives, as seen in debates around platforms like Grok. Others warned that AI’s ability to tailor messages to individuals or groups could enable “surgical” persuasion, bypassing cultural and linguistic barriers.

A recurring theme was the tension between public opinion and elite influence. Some argued that ordinary citizens often rely on “bellyfeel” rather than rational analysis, while interest groups may have a clearer understanding of policy impacts. Others insisted that people are aware of trade-offs, such as with tariffs, and make legitimate cost-benefit judgments. The broader worry was that AI could amplify echo chambers, reinforce prejudices, and deepen polarization, though a few suggested it might also counteract extreme narratives by offering more balanced responses.

Examples shared included historical parallels to mass persuasion, anecdotes about individuals trusting AI over human reasoning, and references to academic work on ideology and discontent. The thread also explored whether manipulation is universal or affects certain groups more, with some claiming highly educated populations are especially vulnerable, while others argued no one is immune. Ultimately, the debate reflected both skepticism and alarm: skepticism that AI changes the fundamentals of persuasion, and alarm that its scale and efficiency could make elite influence more pervasive and harder to resist.
