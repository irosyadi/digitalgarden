## To make children better fact-checkers, expose them to more misinformation — with oversight

The thread revolves around a study from UC Berkeley suggesting that exposing children to misinformation—under adult guidance—can help build their capacity to critically assess claims. Instead of shielding kids from false content online, the researchers advocate for active teaching strategies that encourage skepticism, verification, and source evaluation.

Many participants supported the premise, citing personal experiences with school assignments that required evaluating multiple sources and identifying biases. Commenters recalled lessons on yellow journalism, propaganda techniques, and digital media literacy, with some praising progressive curricula that already include these components at primary and secondary levels. Specific examples, like students dissecting Wikipedia pages or analyzing misleading headlines, were shared as successful implementations of this approach.

However, critics raised concerns about uneven education standards and lack of widespread training for both teachers and parents. Some argued that standardized testing sidelines critical thinking skills, while others worried that politically motivated school boards limit exposure to fact-checking instruction. The thread noted troubling cases where even educators shared biased or misinformed content, calling into question the reliability of those tasked with teaching media literacy.

Supporters countered that despite these inconsistencies, creating habits of skepticism from a young age equips children to navigate increasingly manipulative media ecosystems. They pointed to digital curricula in countries like New Zealand and grassroots efforts by teachers and librarians to foster critical engagement. The discussion emphasized the importance of teaching children how to think—not what to think—and cited tools such as the “House Hippo” PSA and resources on propaganda as accessible entry points for media analysis.

Participants also debated the distinction between evolving scientific consensus and outright misinformation. Some stressed that scientific uncertainty should not be conflated with falsehoods, cautioning against oversimplification in public communication. Others lamented how poorly understood scientific nuance has eroded public trust, blaming sensationalist media and overselling by "science communicators" more than the field itself.

The conversation returned repeatedly to the role of adults, with several noting that many grown-ups themselves struggle with misinformation. This prompted reflections on how teaching children must go hand-in-hand with improving adult literacy and resisting tribalism. Still, others worried that exposing children to false information without proper scaffolding risks reinforcing bias instead of dismantling it.
