## Maybe You’re Not Actually Trying – Community Discussion  
Source: [usefulfictions.substack.com](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying)

The thread centers on the essay’s claim that people often conflate the intention to act with genuine effort, mistaking the feeling of “trying” for meaningful progress. Participants debate whether this distinction is a useful wake-up call or an overly rigid framing of human behavior.

Supporters of the essay argue that the message resonates with common experiences of self-deception. They highlight how individuals rationalize inaction by convincing themselves they are “trying,” when in reality they are avoiding discomfort or discipline. Examples from fitness, learning, and creative work are frequently cited, with commenters noting that sustained practice and persistence, rather than bursts of motivation, are what lead to tangible results. Some participants reference habit formation research, emphasizing that consistency is the true marker of effort.

Critics, however, contend that the essay risks dismissing partial or incremental attempts as meaningless. They argue that effort exists on a spectrum and that small steps, even if imperfect, can build momentum toward larger goals. Several point out that external factors such as mental health, burnout, or situational constraints complicate the notion of “not really trying.” For these commenters, the essay’s uncompromising stance may discourage rather than inspire, especially for those struggling with barriers beyond their control.

Others adopt a middle ground, acknowledging the essay’s value in challenging self-deception while stressing the importance of compassion and nuance. They suggest that recognizing incremental progress does not contradict the call for honesty about one’s actions, but rather complements it. A few participants draw on behavioral psychology to argue that sustainable change often begins with small, imperfect steps that gradually evolve into consistent effort.

Overall, the discussion reflects a tension between the clarity of the essay’s message and the community’s recognition of the complexities of human motivation. While many appreciate the blunt reminder to confront self-deception, others caution against oversimplifying the realities of effort and progress.
