## Facts don't change minds, structure does

The Hacker News discussion revolves around a blog post asserting that facts alone rarely change beliefs, and instead, structured argumentation and contextual framing play a more pivotal role. The conversation spans themes of rationality, epistemic resistance, tribalism, and the sociopolitical influence of information ecosystems.

Many users agree that isolated facts are insufficient for belief revision, noting that people interpret facts through broader narratives. One example given contrasts climate change denial and a single case of data falsification: the latter is not enough to upend a complex consensus. Instead, belief change demands consistent, representative exposure to diverse evidence. Critics argue that modern media—driven by engagement algorithms and biased content creators—fails to deliver such exposure, reinforcing existing biases.

Others introduce psychological and philosophical perspectives. "Epistemic learned helplessness," referenced via Slate Star Codex, captures the defensiveness average individuals adopt when confronted by highly articulate or knowledgeable counterparts. This is seen not as irrational, but as a rational safeguard against intellectual manipulation. Relatedly, contributors highlight the ethos/logos/pathos framework, suggesting that emotionally manipulative arguments often masquerade as rational persuasion, especially when ethos (credibility) and pathos (emotion) overshadow logos (logic). Supporters advocate externalized, logic-driven discourse formats that allow independent review and scrutiny.

Tribal identity surfaces frequently. Arguments against anti-vaccine sentiments exemplify how emotional appeals, framed through in-group loyalty and fear for children, override scientific reasoning. While some posters frame far-right campaigns as emotionally manipulative and strategically divisive, others caution against framing one political side as inherently irrational. They argue that susceptibility to emotional conditioning is broadly distributed and driven by cognitive overload, information asymmetry, and systemic social incentives.

Counterpoints emerge over the rationality of pandemic responses. Some claim that COVID policies were excessively harsh and ideologically rigid, equating them with “religious” adherence rather than evidence-based governance. In response, others detail real-world consequences, citing deaths and health outcomes to support pro-vaccine arguments. Disagreements over causality, risk perception, and individual anecdotes underscore the challenge of reconciling personal experience with statistical reasoning.

Several comments delve into cognitive anatomy and educational shortcomings. A study linking authoritarian attitudes to brain structure is referenced, suggesting biological predispositions may influence ideological rigidity. Meanwhile, contributors bemoan the absence of critical thinking education, suggesting systemic failures exacerbate vulnerability to propaganda. Finally, users discuss foreign state interference via bot farms that exploit social media algorithms—not by posting propaganda directly, but by amplifying divisive content through engagement manipulation.
