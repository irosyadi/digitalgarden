**Using number of books, paintings, albums and papers released by practitioners at each age.**

Interesting research from [Miller (1999)](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781474467889-007/pdf?licenseType=restricted) and [Kanazawa (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009265660200538X)

![Area Graph showing peak age for scientists' major discoveries and publications. The x-axis represents age ranging from 20 to 80, and the y-axis shows the number of discoveries. The purple curve (1935-1965) peaks sharply around age 37, while the green curve (post-1965) peaks more broadly. Annotations indicate that the burden of knowledge increased after 1965, requiring more time to master fields.](https://infobeautiful4.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/07/SM-IIB-Peak-Age-Scientists-SQ.png)
