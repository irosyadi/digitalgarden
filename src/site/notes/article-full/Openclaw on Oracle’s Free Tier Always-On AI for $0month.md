#OpenClaw #OracleFreeTier #AIassistant #TelegramBot  

I wasn’t about to spend $1,500 on a new Mac mini just to try out Openclaw (formerly Moltbot/Clawdbot), but I knew I wanted an always-on AI agent. Something that wouldn’t forget context when I closed my laptop, that I could access from my phone via Telegram, and that could actually *do* things—check email, manage files, run scripts.

Oracle’s Always Free tier solved the hardware problem: 4 ARM cores and 24GB RAM for $0/month. No trials, no expiration. Just free infrastructure that runs 24/7.

This guide walks through the complete setup—from spinning up the instance to having a working AI assistant in your pocket.

## The Setup: Step-by-Step

Here’s exactly how I built it. Total time: ~3 hours. Monthly cost: $0 for infrastructure + $20 Claude Pro subscription.

### Step 1: Sign Up for Oracle Free Tier

1. Go to [oracle.com/cloud/free](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)
2. Click “Start for free”
3. Create account (requires credit card for verification, but it’s never charged)
4. Complete verification

Oracle’s free tier doesn’t expire. These resources remain available as long as the account is active.

### Step 2: Spin Up the Max Free Instance

In the Oracle Cloud Console:

1. **Compute > Instances > Create Instance**
2. **Name:** ai-server (or whatever you want)
3. **Image:** Ubuntu 24.04 (Canonical-Ubuntu-24.04-aarch64)
4. **Shape:**
	- Click “Change Shape”
	- Select “Ampere” (ARM)
	- Choose VM.Standard.A1.Flex
	- Set **4 OCPUs** and **24GB RAM** (maxes out free tier)
5. **Networking:** Use default VCN (creates automatically)
6. **SSH Keys:**
	- Generate a key pair (Download private key!)
	- Or paste your existing public key
7. **Boot Volume:** 200GB (max free tier)
8. Click **Create**

Wait 3-5 minutes for the instance to provision. Note the public IP address.

### Step 3: Initial Server Access

From your terminal:

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
# SSH into your new server
ssh -i /path/to/your/private-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP

# Update packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essentials
sudo apt install -y git curl wget build-essential
```

### Step 4: Install Tailscale (Secure Remote Access)

Tailscale provides secure remote access without exposing SSH to the public internet:

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
# Install Tailscale
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Start and authenticate
sudo tailscale up

# Visit the auth URL it prints, log in, approve device
```

You can now SSH via the Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x) instead of the public IP.

### Step 5: Install Node.js

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
# Install fnm (Fast Node Manager)
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc

# Install latest Node LTS
fnm install --lts
fnm use lts-latest
fnm default lts-latest

# Verify
node --version  # Should show v22.x.x or higher
```

### Step 6: Install Claude CLI

### Step 7: Security Hardening

**Set up fail2ban (blocks brute-force SSH attacks):**

```bash
1
2
3
sudo apt install -y fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

**Configure automatic security updates:**

```bash
1
2
3
sudo apt install -y unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
# Select "Yes" to enable automatic updates
```

**Lock down file permissions:**

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
# Your home directory should be private
chmod 700 ~

# SSH keys should be locked down
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Step 8: Set Up Backups and Self-Healing

**Install rclone for Google Drive backups:**

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
# Install rclone
sudo apt install -y rclone

# Configure Google Drive
rclone config
# Follow prompts: "n" for new remote, name it "gdrive", choose "drive" type

# Create backup script
cat > ~/backup-to-gdrive.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
rclone sync ~/ gdrive:server-backups \
  --exclude node_modules/** \
  --exclude .git/objects/** \
  --exclude .cache/** \
  --log-file ~/backup.log
EOF

chmod +x ~/backup-to-gdrive.sh
```

**Set up automated backup cron job:**

```bash
1
2
3
4
5
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs backup daily at 3 AM):
0 3 * * * /home/ubuntu/backup-to-gdrive.sh
```

### Step 9: Install Openclaw

The wizard will walk you through everything. Most important: the Telegram setup.

### Step 10: Configure Telegram

**Create a Telegram bot:**

1. Open Telegram, search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name (e.g., “My Openclaw Bot”)
4. Choose a username (e.g., `my_openclaw_bot`)
5. Copy the API token BotFather gives you

**Add token to Openclaw:**

During `openclaw onboard`, when asked for Telegram token, paste it.

Or manually add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

**Start the gateway:**

```bash
1
openclaw gateway --daemon
```

**Test it:**

1. Find your bot in Telegram (search for the username you created)
2. Send `/start`
3. Send a message like “What’s the server uptime?”

If it responds, you’re done!

### Step 11: Enable Heartbeat Monitoring (Optional)

Edit `~/openclaw-workspace/HEARTBEAT.md`:

```markdown
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
# Check system status
- Run: \`uptime\` and \`df -h\` to check server health
- If disk usage > 80%, alert me

# Check for important emails (if Gmail configured)
- Run email check script
- Alert if unread from specific senders

# Return HEARTBEAT_OK if nothing needs attention
```

Configure heartbeat interval in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "heartbeat": {
        "every": "30m"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Openclaw will now run checks every 30 minutes and send alerts when needed.
