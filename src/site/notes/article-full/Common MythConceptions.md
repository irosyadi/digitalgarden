## Black 'holes'

Hugely dense objects with massive gravitational pull, creating a hole in the fabric of space time from which light cannot escape. But not a hole in the sense of a portal.

A tall tale. At 5’7”, he was actually above average height for a Frenchman of the time.

Not visible from space to the naked eye. Myth. Now stop saying it!

They actually grow on massive herbs that resemble trees. Bet you didn’t know that.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Oil.png)](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/youre-doing-it-wrong-the-guide-to-making-perfect-pasta-946855/?no-ist)

## Oil stops pasta sticking

Nope. But it can stop the water foaming or boiling over.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Genes.png)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11191-012-9510-4)

## A gene for…

Genes code for proteins, so there are actually no genes ‘for’ specific characteristics, esp. not psychological ones.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Dog.png)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2462491/?page=6)

## Bats are blind

Don’t be fact-blind! Bats can not only see. They can also use echolocation. That’s why they’re so awesome!

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Salieri.png)](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/arts/music/28sali.html?ei=5088&en=7d60688cd81285e2&ex=1261976400&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&adxnnlx=1127322281-E5bLYNdgoI5tijOhmwxecA)

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Eating.png)](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/health/28real.html)

Nope. He failed an entrance exam for a school but still excelled in maths.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Senses.png)](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141118-how-many-senses-do-you-have)

## “Yes, I’m a cop”

US undercover police do not have to identify themselves as cops. A Hollywood-induced myth.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Autism.png)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25108395)

## The “autism epidemic”

There’s only been an increase in diagnoses of autism, caused by heightened awareness and a wider definition of the condition.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Goldfish.png)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10937888/Memory-of-a-goldfish-Actually-fish-can-recall-events-12-days-ago.html)

While not the smartest, goldﬁsh boast a memory span of 3 months – better than most politicians.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Dinosaur.png)](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/faq.php#humansanddinos)

Despite 41% of US adults thinking they coexisted, we actually missed each other by ~63 million years.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Evolution.png)](http://evoled.dbs.umt.edu/lessons/miscon.htm#3)

## Evolution is just a ‘theory’

In science, a ‘theory’ is anything more than a conjecture. Usually an extensively tested idea uniting data from many observations.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Chastity.png)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/chastity-belts-the-odd-truth-about-locking-up-womens-genitalia/)

## Glass is a liquid

Actually an ‘amorphous solid’. ‘But that‘s why stained-glass windows are thicker at the bottom.’ Nope. It’s just badly made glass.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Coffee.png)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-277X.2003.00477.x/abstract;jsessionid=FEF7ACBFCA00771BBF41FD39B24DFAE4.d02t04)

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Shaving.png)](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/hair-removal/faq-20058427)

## Shaving thickens hair

Regrown hair isn’t thicker, coarser or darker. It just appears so because it’s no longer tapered.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Sugar.png)](http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2769)

Studies have disproved this. ADHD and poor behaviours still occurs in children with sugar-free diets.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Vaccine.png)](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full)

Groundless fears based on fraudulent research that’s been shown to have been manipulated.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Proof.png)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1949-8594.1996.tb10205.x/abstract)

## Scientific proof

No such thing. Proof is incompatible with science which is, by its nature, provisional and self-correcting. Only Maths has proofs.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Penny.png)](http://uk.businessinsider.com/drop-penny-off-empire-state-building-2015-12)

## Dropped pennies kill

Terminal velocity of a penny is 30–50 mph, which isn’t fast enough. It would hurt, though.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Hemisphere.png)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222)

## Left & right brain

There's no evidence that creativity or logic reside in a particular side of the brain, or that a person can be "left-" or "right-brained".

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_ThreeMen.png)](http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/3wisemen.asp)

## The three wise men

Nowhere in the New Testament does it specify there were three.

## Alcohol is warming

Dilates warm blood vessels near the skin, creating the impression of warmth. It can actually drop core body temp.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Fatwa.png)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124693/?tool=pmcentrez)

## Fatwa = death

Not a death sentence. It actually means ‘non-binding legal opinion’.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_TenPercent.png)](http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_ten-percent_myth/)

## Only 10% of brain

Misunderstood metaphor. Proportion of our brain ‘firing’ is task-dependent and maybe as low as 10%. But, ultimately, all cells are important.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_Satan.png)](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201306/is-satan-a-real-person/#?insight[search_id]=c8702e92-fd1d-401f-a6df-ae41bea1f1a3&insight[search_result_index]=2)

## Washington smoked weed, dude

He grew hemp to make rope & clothes, but there’s no evidence he smoked a phat one most nights.

[![](https://vizsweet.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mythconceptions3/IIB_Common-Mythconceptions_CHARTICLE_V3_jesus.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_the_birth_of_Jesus)

## Jesus born on 25th

Christmas day was made the official date in 350 CE. Maybe based on winter solstice. Or just made up
