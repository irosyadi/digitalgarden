This director’s cut of *The Act of Killing* features commentary from filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer and executive producer Werner Herzog, offering deep insights into the making and significance of the documentary. The film explores Indonesia’s 1965–66 anti-communist purge through the eyes of the perpetrators, who openly reenact their past atrocities in stylized performances inspired by Hollywood films. The commentary provides historical context and examines how mass murderers continue to shape Indonesia’s political landscape.

Oppenheimer discusses his investigative process, describing how he built trust with former death squad leaders while capturing their disturbingly candid recollections. He explains how the killers use cinema as a means to glorify and rationalize their crimes, turning reenactments into surreal performances of power and denial. Herzog adds reflections on filmmaking ethics and the unsettling intersections between political violence and performance. The conversation also touches on Indonesia’s historical silence regarding the genocide and the film’s role in disrupting that narrative.

As the documentary progresses, the commentary highlights Anwar Congo, the central figure, who undergoes a complex transformation. Initially boasting about his killings, he gradually faces the psychological toll of his past. The film culminates in a haunting moment where Anwar physically reenacts the suffering of his victims, unable to contain his emotional breakdown. Herzog and Oppenheimer analyze this final sequence, questioning whether true reckoning is possible for perpetrators still embedded in a corrupt system.

By juxtaposing entertainment, propaganda, and genocide, *The Act of Killing* becomes an indictment of collective memory and the political structures that sustain impunity. The commentary reinforces the film’s eerie blend of horror and absurdity, revealing how historical atrocities are woven into daily life and political spectacle.
