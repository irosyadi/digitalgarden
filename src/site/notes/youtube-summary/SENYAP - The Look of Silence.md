## SENYAP - The Look of Silence  

Source: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcvH2hvvGh4)  

Joshua Oppenheimer's *The Look of Silence* is a haunting documentary that delves into Indonesia’s dark history of mass killings in 1965. The film follows Adi, an optometrist whose brother was brutally murdered during the purge of alleged communists. Through quiet but pointed conversations, Adi confronts the men responsible, forcing them to revisit their actions decades later. These exchanges expose both the perpetrators’ lingering justifications and the deep scars left on survivors. The documentary juxtaposes serene landscapes with the chilling recollections of violence, underscoring the pervasiveness of silence and fear in Indonesian society. *The Look of Silence* is a powerful exploration of memory, trauma, and the unresolved wounds of history.
