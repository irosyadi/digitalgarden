## Taxonomy of Procrastination

### Taxum 1: Doing the thing is too unpleasant compared to not doing the thing

### Taxum 2: You don’t really believe that doing the thing will work

**Sub-taxum A: You don’t think you have the ability.**  
**Sub-taxum B: You don’t think you have a good plan.**

### Taxum 3: Even if you successfully did the thing, you don’t really think it will matter

**Sub-taxum A: You think no one else will care.**  
**Sub-taxum B: You yourself won’t care.**

### Taxum 4: The timeline is too long

If you want to do a thing and

- you like doing it; and  
- you’re sure it will work; and
- you’re sure it will be awesome; and
- you’ll get the benefits quickly;  
then it will be easy. So if you’re procrastinating, look for the bottleneck.

## Let’s consider the standard tricks

**Make doing the thing more pleasant.**  
**Make _not_ doing the thing more _un_pleasant (or impossible).**  
**Work on the thing with others.**  
**Break the thing down into a todo list.**  
**Do a different thing.**  
**Be honest about your motivations for the thing.**  
**Take drugs**

## 5-stages of Grief to Overcome Procrastination

1. _Denial_ of the importance or urgency of the task, and denial of my future self also lacking desire and willpower to complete said task in the future.  
2. _Anger_ that I cannot magically will myself into not procrastinating, or anger that I even have to do the task in the first place.  
3. _Bargaining_ how far back I can push a task back a.k.a. "I'll have plenty of time to do it tomorrow."  
4. _Depression_ because I always mismanage my time, overestimate my future abilities, and seem to never learn from the past -- "why do I always do this to myself?"  
5. _Acceptance_ that I am at the end of my rope, and I have to do the task now or I will face some kind of consequences far worse than actually doing the task itself.

## Tips

- Just "spend the next hour" on that thing.
- Vomit writing technique. I will just drag myself to get started no matter how horrible the work I am doing in the beginning. But once I started doing, I won't feel so bad. This basically solved my problem.
- Most of the time it's anxiety. You'd be surprised how easy it is to start doing something when you don't feel any kind of pressure. Getting rid of it is hard work though, sometimes even harder than doing the thing you're procrastinating about.
