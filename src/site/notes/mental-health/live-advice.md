# Live Advice

- You gotta kill the person you were born to be to become the person you want to be.
- Be unapologetically authentic.
- Think by writing.
- You have to go first. If you don't make it happen, it doesn't happen.
- There are no tricks, that's just a distraction. Just sit down and do it. Ass in chair gets you there.
- Every time you want to say “x is wrong”, say “I think x has problem y” and either offer a solution for y or ask how it could be solved.
- Basically, most of the things that are put in place have a reason behind it. You don't have to agree with the reason, but you must understand it before trying to solve a problem.
- I'm not responsible for solving other people's problems and behavior.
- Stop worrying and be happy. Worrying doesn't help the problems or generate solutions, it only makes it worse.
- Your mind is prone to misinterpret situations and your thinking does not always reflect reality.
- Reputation takes a lifetime to build, but only seconds to destroy.
- If you keep only planning your whole life out, you're going to end up miserable.
- Does it need to be said? Does it need to be said now? Does it need to be said by me?
- Speak last.
- Everything has a value
- What got you to this level won’t get you to the next.
- Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do good now! Walk justly now! No one is expected to complete the work, but neither may any one desist from it.
- Wishing without work, is like fishing without bait.
- The difference between try and triumph is just a little umph!
- if you truly want to do something, you do it
- If something needs to be done, and it takes less than two minutes to do, just do it right now.
