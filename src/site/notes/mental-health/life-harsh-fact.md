# Harsh Facts about Life

- Just because you go out of your way for people, it doesn't mean they will do the same for you.
- It is possible to make no mistake, and still lose. That is not a weakness, that is life
- It is possible to royally fuck things up, and still win
- You can't keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay.
- Your trauma is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.
- Shared trauma is not a good foundation for a relationship.
- Some people will hurt you, and they won't care how you feel about it.
- Failure is part of life.
- Life is not automatically easier just because you're a good person.
- Expecting life to treat you well because you are good is like expecting the bull not to charge at you because you are vegetarian
- You can love someone with all of your heart and not be loved back in the same way.
- Bad things can happen to good people. Good things can happen to bad people. It’s unfair. It’s life.
- You can do everything perfectly correct and still fail.
- Just because life is unfair doesn't mean we shouldn't make an effort to _be_ fair. It's easy to take this adage too far and hide behind it.
- Having a moral compass and being a good person usually means you have a line in the sand somewhere, and there will always be someone who is willing to go further than you, undercut you or out compete you.
- Not everyone likes you, and you cannot make all people like you.
- Sometimes you're the bad guy. Sometimes, no one is the bad guy.

- You don't realize the good/best times as they are happening
- You can become disabled unexpectedly at any point in your life. Make sure you’re taking advantage of the abilities you have while you have them
- I thought I'd be happy when I graduated college, or when I got my first apartment, or when I bought my first home. **Don't expect happiness to be at the finish line.** Happiness comes from yourself, in the **now**. Enjoy the process.
- Nobody is coming to save you. You have to do it yourself.
- Be the person you needed while you were growing up.
- People don’t think about you as much as you think they do. That means that your feelings might be ignored or not considered, people will forget things about you and might not remember things you’ve done together that were very memorable for you. On the other hand, they probably don’t remember that embarrassing thing you did (or they don’t care about it), they notice patterns of behaviours, more than occasional bad days that you have. So those times you feel bad about being “off” with someone, they probably don’t think about them, unless they become frequent.
- Everyone is too busy cringing over their own mishaps to worry about that one time you did something embarrassing.
- It won't just happen. The truth is, eventually doesn't come if you don't make it come. Improvement has to be proactive.

- Not everything is a lesson Ryan, sometimes you just fail.
- You don't have as many friends or family as you think.
- Nobody cares! So just go for it, everyone's busy with themselves to pay too much attention to what you are doing. At the end of the day nobody cares about you, nobody is going to bed at night thinking of your problems
- Life is not fair. Expecting it to be, will always disappoint you. People will get special treatment for all kinds of things. It will never change.
- Hard work won't guarantee a thing. But without it, you don't stand a chance.
- You can't get your time back. Stop wasting it.
- For most of us work is a business transaction. You’re trading your time for money. Your employer isn’t your friend, father or mother, they owe you what they promise to give you in exchange for your time. That’s it. If your work isn’t fulfilling or making you happy, either spend your free time making yourself happy or work somewhere else.
- Nothing last forever
- It's not your fault, but it's still your responsibility to deal with it.
