## Surveillance Secrets

Lighthouse Reports’ “Surveillance Secrets” investigation exposes the global reach and ethical void of the modern surveillance industry through a deep dive into First Wap, a little-known but powerful phone-tracking company. The investigation began with a massive leak: an archive of 1.5 million tracking records tied to over 14,000 phone numbers across 160 countries. This trove revealed how First Wap’s flagship software, Altamides, was used not just by governments but also by private corporations and individuals to monitor targets ranging from political dissidents and journalists to celebrities and ordinary citizens.

The reporting team, comprising over 70 journalists from 14 outlets, uncovered how First Wap marketed its tools to authoritarian regimes and corporate clients, often skirting international sanctions through shell companies and offshore deals. Undercover footage from a surveillance tech trade fair in Prague captured a First Wap executive discussing how to circumvent legal risks by routing deals through Jakarta. Despite the company’s claims that its tools are used solely for lawful purposes, the investigation documents widespread abuse, including stalking, political repression, and commercial espionage.

The Altamides system exploits vulnerabilities in global telecom infrastructure, allowing real-time location tracking and even access to encrypted communications. Victims include high-profile figures like Anne Wojcicki, Erik Prince, and Gianluigi Nuzzi, as well as lesser-known individuals targeted for personal or political reasons. The investigation dismantles the narrative that surveillance tech is tightly controlled and used only for legitimate law enforcement, revealing instead a shadowy ecosystem with few safeguards and global consequences.
