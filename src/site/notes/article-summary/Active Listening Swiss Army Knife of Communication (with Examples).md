## Active Listening: Swiss Army Knife of Communication  
Source: [togetherlondon.com](https://togetherlondon.com/insights/active-listening-swiss-army-knife) 

Active listening is presented as a transformative communication technique that fosters empathy, trust, and deeper understanding across a wide range of contexts—from professional meetings to personal relationships. Developed by psychologists Carl Rogers and Richard Farson in 1957, the method involves fully focusing on another person’s perspective, reflecting back what was heard in your own words, and checking for accuracy. This cyclical process—listen, reflect, verify—helps uncover not just facts but the underlying emotions and needs driving someone’s words.

The article emphasizes that active listening is not about offering advice or solving problems, but about helping others articulate and explore their own experiences. It’s especially powerful in situations of conflict, emotional distress, or when clarity is needed. The technique requires effort and vulnerability, as listeners must take risks in interpreting feelings and be open to correction. Yet, it’s accessible to anyone, regardless of background knowledge, and can be practiced with anyone—from colleagues to children.

Practical guidance is offered through a simple formula and real-life examples, illustrating how active listening differs from typical conversational habits like sharing personal anecdotes or offering solutions. The author also outlines when not to use the technique, such as in casual exchanges or when personal needs prevent deep engagement. Ultimately, active listening is framed as a generous, adaptable tool that, when practiced regularly, becomes second nature and enriches all forms of human connection.
