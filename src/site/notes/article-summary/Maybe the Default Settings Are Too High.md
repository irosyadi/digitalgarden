## Maybe the Default Settings Are Too High  
Source: [raptitude.com](https://www.raptitude.com/2025/12/maybe-the-default-settings-are-too-high)

This essay reflects on the surprising rewards of slowing down everyday activities, particularly reading and eating. The author describes reading *The Lord of the Rings* aloud at a deliberately slow pace, savoring each sentence rather than rushing through the pages. This approach revealed a richer, more immersive experience, allowing the imagery and meaning to unfold more fully. The insight parallels eating slowly, where greater enjoyment and satisfaction arise from giving each bite more attention, rather than rushing to consume more.

The piece argues that modern life encourages us to consume too quickly—whether books, food, or information—diminishing the depth of what we actually seek. By reducing our “default settings” for speed, we unlock more of the inherent value in these experiences. The author likens this to vacuuming: moving too fast misses the deeper rewards, while slowing down allows the process to work as intended. This principle extends beyond reading and eating to nearly all aspects of life, from writing shopping lists to savoring homemade meals. Ultimately, slowing down not only enhances comprehension and pleasure but also shifts our preferences, revealing the emptiness of shallow, mass-produced content and the richness of carefully crafted works.

The essay concludes with an invitation to experiment: try consuming at one-third your usual speed and notice how much more meaning and satisfaction emerge. It’s not about moral judgment but about reclaiming the deeper rewards that only patience and attentiveness can reveal.
