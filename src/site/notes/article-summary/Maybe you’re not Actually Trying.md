## Maybe You’re Not Actually Trying  
Source: [usefulfictions.substack.com](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying)

The article explores the subtle difference between believing we are making an effort and actually committing to meaningful action. It argues that many people confuse intention with execution, mistaking the feeling of wanting to change for the reality of doing the work required. The piece highlights how self-deception often arises when we rationalize our lack of progress, convincing ourselves that we are “trying” when in fact we are avoiding discomfort, risk, or sustained discipline.  

The author emphasizes that genuine effort is not about occasional bursts of motivation but about consistent practice, even when it feels tedious or challenging. True progress requires confronting resistance and pushing through the moments when quitting seems easier. By recognizing the gap between our self-perception and our actual behavior, we can begin to close it—transforming vague aspirations into tangible results.  

Ultimately, the essay serves as a reminder that growth demands honesty with ourselves. It challenges readers to examine whether they are truly acting toward their goals or merely rehearsing the idea of effort without commitment.
