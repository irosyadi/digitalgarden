## First-ever recording of a dying human brain shows waves similar to memory flashbacks

In a groundbreaking study led by Dr. Ajmal Zemmar at the University of Louisville, researchers captured the first-ever recording of brain activity during the transition to death. The data came from an 87-year-old epilepsy patient who unexpectedly suffered a fatal heart attack while undergoing continuous EEG monitoring. This rare opportunity allowed scientists to observe 900 seconds of brain activity, with a focus on the 30 seconds before and after cardiac arrest.

The study revealed notable changes in gamma oscillations—brain waves associated with high-level cognitive functions like memory recall, dreaming, and meditation—alongside shifts in other wave types such as delta, theta, alpha, and beta. These patterns suggest the brain may engage in a final "life recall," akin to near-death experiences where individuals report vivid memories flashing before them. While the findings are based on a single case and must be interpreted cautiously due to the patient's neurological condition, they raise profound scientific, philosophical, and spiritual questions about consciousness and the definition of death.

Dr. Zemmar emphasizes the implications for organ donation timing and the broader understanding of what happens in the brain during death. He also reflects on the comforting possibility that the dying brain may replay cherished life moments, offering solace to grieving families and prompting deeper inquiry into the nature of human consciousness.
