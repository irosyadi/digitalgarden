## Social anxiety isn't about being liked  
Source: [chrislakin.blog](https://chrislakin.blog/p/social-anxiety)

Chris Lakin challenges the common misconception that social anxiety stems from a fear of being disliked. Instead, he argues that the core issue is a fear of being noticed—of drawing attention, being scrutinized, or disrupting the social equilibrium. Socially anxious individuals often crave invisibility, not approval, and their discomfort arises from the perceived threat of exposure rather than rejection. Lakin explores how this manifests in everyday situations, such as avoiding eye contact or hesitating to speak up, not because of low self-esteem, but due to a heightened sensitivity to social dynamics and perceived disruption.
