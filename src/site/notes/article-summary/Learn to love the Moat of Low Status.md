## Learn to Love the Moat of Low Status  

Source: [usefulfictions.substack.com](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/learn-to-love-the-moat-of-low-status)

In this excerpt from her upcoming book, Cate Hall explores how fear of temporary low status—what she calls the “Moat of Low Status”—prevents people from pursuing meaningful growth. Whether it’s hesitating to dance first at a party or avoiding a creative pursuit for fear of early inadequacy, Hall illustrates how this apprehension stifles potential. She argues that initial incompetence is not only inevitable in learning but also vital to transformation, likening the moat to a barrier that one must willingly pass through in order to reach mastery.

Hall draws from personal experiences in poker and life to show how public failures and embarrassment, while painful, did not destroy her. Instead, they taught resilience. The key, she suggests, is not finding a way to avoid humiliation but learning to bear it—seeing it as part of the journey rather than an obstacle. Through vivid anecdotes and introspective reflections, she posits that moments of embarrassment can unlock a renewed sense of curiosity and wonder, returning us to the disorienting yet thrilling space of real learning.

She offers practical tools for navigating the moat—like meditation, reframing embarrassment as rule-breaking, and visualizing long-term gains—but emphasizes there’s no shortcut. Embracing discomfort and accepting vulnerability are the real routes to skill acquisition, creativity, and a richer life. Ultimately, Hall’s message is clear: walk straight into the moat, feel the sting, and keep going—the world doesn’t turn to ash.
