### 🖋️ Cormac McCarthy’s Writing Wisdom for Scientists

For over 20 years, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Cormac McCarthy has helped scientists at the Santa Fe Institute refine their writing. His advice, distilled by Van Savage and Pamela Yeh, emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and storytelling.

### ✨ Key Principles

- **Simplicity is paramount**: Focus on telling a coherent, compelling story with minimal clutter.
- **Minimalism for clarity**: Remove unnecessary punctuation, words, or sections if they don’t serve the core message.
- **Define your theme**: Choose 2–3 key points and ensure every part of the paper supports them.
- **One idea per paragraph**: Even a single sentence can stand alone if it conveys a clear message.

---

### 🧠 Style and Structure Tips

- **Short, direct sentences**: Avoid complex constructions and excessive transition words.
- **No footnotes or jargon**: These disrupt flow and alienate readers.
- **Avoid repetition and over-explanation**: Say things once, clearly.
- **Grammar guided by speech**: Prioritize being understood over strict rules.

---

### ✍️ Tone and Voice

- **Use a personal, engaging tone**: Passive voice doesn’t make writing more objective.
- **Colloquial language is okay**: But avoid region-specific expressions.
- **Concrete examples**: Replace abstract terms with vivid imagery (e.g., “red balloon” instead of “colored sphere”).

---

### 🔢 Handling Equations

- Keep math separate from prose using line breaks and intuitive notation.
- Explain transitions between assumptions, equations, and results clearly.

---

### 📚 Final Steps

- **Read aloud**: It helps catch awkward phrasing and rhythm issues.
- **Find a trusted editor**: Make their job easier with clean formatting.
- **Accept feedback gracefully**: Revise when needed, but defend your choices respectfully.
- **Write for yourself**: Aim to create a paper you’re proud of, not one tailored to anonymous reviewers.
