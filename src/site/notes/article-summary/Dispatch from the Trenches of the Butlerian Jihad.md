## Dispatch from the Trenches of the Butlerian Jihad

The article explores the growing resistance to AI within creative and educational spaces, likening the movement to the "Butlerian Jihad" from *Dune*—the fictional war against thinking machines. The author, a teacher and writer, discusses the ways AI has infiltrated academia, particularly as a tool for students to bypass the cognitive effort needed for learning. While some educators attempt to integrate AI as a beneficial tool, many see it as a shortcut that undermines true intellectual engagement. The concern goes beyond plagiarism—AI-generated work often lacks depth, originality, and true comprehension.

There’s a rising sentiment, spanning from Tumblr users to Pulitzer Prize winners, that any involvement with AI threatens creative integrity. The entertainment industry has echoed this skepticism, with anti-AI clauses in book contracts and vocal opposition at major events like Comic-Con. The author reflects on the increasingly adversarial nature of teaching, as AI-facilitated cheating makes grading and feedback more complex. They argue that engagement with AI-generated text dulls critical thinking, likening it to using a forklift at the gym—skipping the necessary struggle that builds intellectual strength.

To counteract these trends, the author proposes an analog approach: pen-and-paper assignments to reconnect students with the process of writing. They emphasize the broader societal implications of AI dependence, comparing it to historical cases of widespread addiction, such as laudanum in the 19th century. The piece concludes by advocating for a return to human-centered learning, where the struggle of thinking and writing is valued—not avoided.
