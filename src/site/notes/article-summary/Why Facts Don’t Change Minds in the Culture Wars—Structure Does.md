## Why Facts Don’t Change Minds in the Culture Wars—Structure Does  

Source: [vasily.cc](https://vasily.cc/blog/facts-dont-change-minds/)

This thought-provoking piece argues that belief systems function not merely as collections of facts, but as deeply interconnected structures of ideas, values, and identity. Using Galileo’s clash with the Catholic Church as a historical anchor, the author illustrates how the geocentric worldview was embedded within a wider conceptual framework that governed religious authority, daily life, and cosmological meaning. Challenging heliocentrism wasn’t just a scientific dispute—it threatened the entire cognitive architecture of Christian society.

The article introduces the concept of “belief graphs,” visual representations of how ideas reinforce and depend on each other. These graphs are remarkably resilient because human cognition defends them through mechanisms like motivated reasoning and cognitive dissonance. The author explores two belief templates—Growth-First Capitalism and Ecological Sustainability—to show how competing systems operate structurally rather than simply ideologically.

What makes belief graphs powerful and resistant isn’t factual correctness but structural coherence and emotional salience. Attempts to change minds often fail because they ignore these underlying architectures. Whether through targeted "node attacks" or "edge attacks," even modest structural disruptions can weaken entire systems. Moreover, coordinated disinformation campaigns exploit this logic at scale, not to promote specific ideas, but to sever the connections that stabilize belief systems—creating confusion and weakening collective resolve.

Ultimately, the author suggests that resilience against manipulation comes from understanding and strengthening the internal coherence of one’s beliefs. Truth, the article argues, survives not because it’s provable, but because it’s embedded in structures people can inhabit, trust, and defend. This shift—from debating facts to mapping belief architecture—offers a strategic lens for navigating polarized discourse in the culture wars.
