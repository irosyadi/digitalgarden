## How to Stay Sane in a World That Rewards Insanity

The article explores how modern social and cultural incentives increasingly reward extremism over reasonableness. The author reflects on how intelligent people have embraced polarized, uncompromising positions because these stances yield attention, influence, and even financial gain. In contrast, moderation and nuance often fail to attract engagement, leaving rational voices sidelined. This dynamic creates a cycle where individuals become trapped by their own ideological purity, unable to change their minds without losing credibility or community.

The piece warns that such incentives erode society’s ability to solve complex problems, as every issue becomes framed as existential and every conversation reduced to tribal performance. To resist this pull, the author suggests diversifying one’s information sources, distinguishing between stakes and truth, and seeking communities that value humility and truth-seeking over loyalty to a side. While choosing sanity may mean sacrificing reach, certainty, and influence, it offers long-term benefits: clearer thinking, genuine relationships, and the freedom to grow beyond rigid ideological boundaries. Extremism may deliver quick wins, but sanity compounds over time, offering limitless potential for growth.
