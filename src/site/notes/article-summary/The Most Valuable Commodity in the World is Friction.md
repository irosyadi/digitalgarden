## The Most Valuable Commodity in the World is Friction  

Source: [substack.com](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-most-valuable-commodity-in-the)  

The article argues that \\"friction\\" – the effort needed to navigate systems – is being redistributed in the modern economy, creating three distinct worlds:

1. **The Digital World:** Characterized by near-zero friction, exemplified by AI chatbots and seamless interfaces. This fosters a \\"simulation economy\\" where real-world effort is devalued, potentially leading to cognitive offloading and isolation.
2. **The Physical World:** Overburdened with friction due to deteriorating infrastructure (e.g., FAA system failures), despite digital systems depending on it.
3. **The Curated Real World:** Spaces where friction is stylized and can be bought out of (e.g., optimized lifestyles in affluent neighborhoods), offering an illusion of effortless living for those who can afford it.

The author posits that friction isn't eliminated but transferred, often from digital/curated realms to the underfunded physical world or onto overworked labor. This imbalance has societal consequences, but friction itself can be informative, signaling areas needing investment and care. The piece concludes by suggesting a need to redirect effort towards sustainable systems rather than just eliminating or aestheticizing friction.
