## How to increase your surface area for luck

Cate Hall’s reflection on cultivating luck explores the idea that serendipity favors those who consistently engage with the world. Drawing from personal experiences and observations, Hall emphasizes that success often stems not from precision or planning, but from increasing the number of attempts—what she calls “shots on goal.” By meeting new people, experimenting with ideas, and showing up for opportunities that may seem low-stakes or tangential, individuals expand their surface area for luck and position themselves to catch unexpected breaks.

The piece suggests that curiosity-driven conversations, generosity without expectations, and consistently treating even small tasks with care can transform one’s trajectory. Hall likens this to gardening: one cannot force results, but can prepare fertile ground. She encourages readers to publish their thoughts online to express genuine interests and invite unexpected opportunities, and to host simple social events to organically build networks. Importantly, she reassures that initial awkwardness or aimlessness in this process is normal—it’s through this social “flailing” that clarity and connection begin to take shape.

In closing, Hall shares that her journey was unpredictable and nonlinear, underscoring that creating luck isn't about knowing outcomes but embracing the unknown with action, openness, and persistence.
