## Smart People Don't Chase Goals; They Create Limits  

Source: [joanwestenberg.com](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/smart-people-dont-chase-goals-they-create-limits/)

Joan Westenberg challenges conventional goal-setting by arguing that true progress is shaped by constraints rather than milestones. She reflects on personal experiences of chasing achievements that ultimately felt hollow, leading her to rethink the structure of ambition. Instead of measuring success by predefined objectives, she advocates for setting boundaries—defining what one refuses to compromise in their work and life.

Drawing from historical examples, she critiques the enduring myth that goal-setting guarantees success, highlighting its deceptive sense of control. Innovators like John Boyd and Richard Feynman advanced their fields not by setting fixed targets, but by embracing limitations that fostered creativity. Constraints, she argues, do not stifle progress—they refine it, much like the structured rules behind poetry or jazz.

The essay dismantles the seductive appeal of goals, exposing how they often serve as placeholders for uncertainty rather than genuine direction. Westenberg proposes a shift toward constraint-driven decision-making, which allows for adaptability, deeper alignment, and sustained momentum. By embracing constraints, individuals can build meaningful careers and lives, avoiding the pitfalls of rigid aspirations and achieving something more lasting than a mere finish line.
