## Tech Culture
- [The maze is in the mouse. What ails Google. And how it can turn… | by Praveen Seshadri | Feb, 2023 | Medium](https://medium.com/@pravse/the-maze-is-in-the-mouse-980c57cfd61a)
	- at some point the problem is no longer that the mouse is in a maze. The problem is that “the maze is in the mouse”.
	- The way I see it, Google has four core cultural problems. They are all the natural consequences of having a money-printing machine called “Ads” that has kept growing relentlessly every year, hiding all other sins.  (1) no mission, (2) no urgency, (3) delusions of exceptionalism, (4) mismanagement.
	- Does anyone at Google come into work actually thinking about “organizing the world’s information”? They have lost track of who they serve and why. They serve their manager or their VP. They serve other employees.
	- The equation would change if the focus instead were on value creation. If you asked daily: “who did I create value for today”, you’d get to very different behavior. If every half-yearly plan identified “how much value will be generated in the world”, then that would lead to different thinking. I’d work harder if I could create more value and have more impact.
