# Why Blogging

Why am I blogging?
There are some reason why I am blogging and make them public:

- Solidify my knowledge in a given topic. The best way to know that you are really know is by writing it or by teaching it.
- Improve my writing. I'm very bad at English, both for writing and speaking. To improve these, I try to think something in English and then speak it internally in my mind the write it on the blog.
- Create reference material that will be useful for myself (and may be for to the other). I forgot a lot, that's why I need many notes for reminding me. So I wrote these for my future me.

Why writing?

> As he practiced his writing, Jijingi came to understand what Moseby had meant; writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldnâ€™t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.
